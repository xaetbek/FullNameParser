### âœ… FullNameParser
- Prompts the user to enter their name in either `first last` or `first middle last` format
- Trims extra spaces from the input
- Parses the name into first, middle, and last parts
- Displays "(none)" for middle name if it was not provided
- Uses `split()`, conditionals, and arrays to handle flexible input
